# Stage 0
This stage represents the construction of the first functional model.

The file stage_0.ipynb contains the Python code that creates and tests the model.

The file prf_0.xlsx contains the prf-values for the model in stage 0 (sheet 0_TD_x for data set x, with x between 1 and 2).

As it can be seen from the code, the pfr-values are guaranteed for short sentences (maximum 5 words) with 1 or 2 entities.

The reason for this is the limitation in length of the sentences from the train data.
This problem will be treated in Stage 1.

For details regarding the way the model was constructed in this phase of the project, please check the README.md file in the main folder.
